## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS for styling
- Flexbox for layout structure
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this challenge, I gained better insight into creating small, reusable components with semantic HTML. A key takeaway was mastering CSS Flexbox to properly align content and ensure responsiveness. Here's a small snippet of the code I'm proud of:

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

- Enhance responsiveness by exploring CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels and better semantic tags.
